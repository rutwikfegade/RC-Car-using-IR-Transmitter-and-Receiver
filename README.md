## RC-Car-using-IR-Transmitter-and-Receiver

On the car, a TSOP1738 IR receiver is used in connection with an Arduino.
The transmitter currently uses a standard television remote to send IR signals.
Four 60 rpm BO motors and one l298n motor driver are used in the car.
As of now, two 18650 lithium batteries are used in series for power.
